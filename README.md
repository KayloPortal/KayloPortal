# Hi, I'm Parsa 👋 

### CSE Student | AI Research Enthusiast | Former Frontend Learner

I am a second-semester Computer Science student based in Shiraz. After spending ~1.5 years learning the ins and outs of Frontend Development (React/JS), I realized my true passion lies in the math and logic of **Artificial Intelligence**. 

I am now dedicating my full focus to Machine Learning, bringing the coding discipline I learned from web dev into my research code.

## 🚀 The Transition
* **Past:** ~15 months of self-taught Frontend Development. I learned how to structure code, manage state (React), and build clean UIs.
* **Present:** Applying that structured thinking to **Data Science & ML**. I don't just want to run models; I want to understand the *why* behind the weights.

## 🔬 Current Research Focus
I am currently exploring **Regression Analysis** and **Noise reduction** in datasets.
* **[Kaggle: Appliances Energy Prediction](https://github.com/KayloPortal/kaggle_appliances_energy_prediction)**
    * **The Challenge:** A high-noise dataset where standard regression fails.
    * **The Solution:** Implemented **Ridge Regression** with **Trigonometric Feature Encoding** to capture cyclical patterns (time of day/week).
    * **Key Finding:** Achieved a balance between bias and variance, prioritizing stability over raw training accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal
* **Core:** Python.
* **AI/ML:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
* **Web Legacy:** JavaScript, React.js, CSS (I still use these to visualize my data!).
