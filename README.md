# Hi there, I'm Parsa Mahmoodi 👋

**Computer Science Student | Aspiring AI Researcher | Predictive Modeling & Optimization**

I am a second-semester CS student deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence, specifically the mathematics and theory behind Machine Learning models. While I began my coding journey building front-end applications, my current focus is entirely on algorithms, data science, and AI research. 

I believe in understanding the *why* behind the code, not just the *how*.

### 🔬 Current Focus & Research Interests
* **Machine Learning:** Currently exploring the Bias-Variance tradeoff, high-dimensional feature selection, and optimization limits in linear and polynomial models.
* **Data Engineering:** Learning how to handle highly noisy datasets using advanced encoding techniques (like Cyclical/Trigonometric encoding) and L1/L2 Regularization.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **AI & Data Science:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Core Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript (Legacy Front-End Projects)
* **Concepts:** Linear Regression (OLS, Ridge, Lasso), Polynomial Expansion, Cross-Validation, Feature Engineering

### 📊 Featured Projects
* **[Appliances Energy Prediction](https://github.com/KayloPortal/kaggle_appliances_energy_prediction):** A study analyzing the mathematical limits of linear models on highly noisy data. Features deep dives into Duality Gaps, the Curse of Dimensionality, and Lasso/Ridge hyperparameter stalemates.
* **[California Housing Price](https://github.com/KayloPortal/California_Housing_Price):** End-to-end regression model pipeline for predictive housing price analysis.
* **[CodeForces Solutions](https://github.com/KayloPortal/CodeForcesRepo):** My personal repository of C++ algorithmic problem-solving.
